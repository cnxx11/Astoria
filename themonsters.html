    <h2>The Monsters</h2>
    <p>Creator/Artist: Kasing Lung</p>
    <p>Birth: Hong Kong, SaR</p>
    <br>
    <p> In 2015, Kasing Lung created a fairy world in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology, and populated it it with magical characters both good and evil,calling them The Monsters. Among them, the most prominent one was LABUBU, a small monster with high, pointed ears and serrated teeth. Despite a mischievous look, LABUBU is kind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite.</p>
    <br>
    <p> <b> The Story of Puca, Pato and the Girl, and Miro's Requiem:</b> The original illustrated books that established the "Monsters" universe, introducing Labubu as one of a tribe of 100 cat-sized elves in a dark, mythical forest setting.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b> The Monsters Toys Series:</b> A nostalgic theme paying tribute to vintage, classic childhood toys, featuring variations like a clockwork robot, a plush doll, and a tin toy. </p>
    <br>
    <p><b> The Monsters Wacky Mart Series:</b> This series is set in a convenience store, where Labubu and her friends are running wild and taking over the various aisles, complete with cashier uniforms and snack aisle chaos</p>
